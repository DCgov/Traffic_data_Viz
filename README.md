# Traffic Vizualizataion #

The application will develop codes for developing new data vizulaizations for viewing traffic data. The project is currently developed under DDOT and is available for any one to use 

More information will posted as the project develops 

## Environment Setup ##

The codes are yet to be runnable before the environment is completely set up. 
A web service with a Python backend as the CGI-handler is required.

For example, our environment setup is:
* IIS 7.0
* Python 2.7
* MSSQL Server 2008 

jquery (http://jquery.com/) and d3.js (http://d3js.org/) are applied for frontend development.

We load the data from database, but it is capable for loading files with few simple modifications.
